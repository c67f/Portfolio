Mech Fight is the rules for a board game I designed.

Mental Mage is a Construct3 game made as part of a group of 3 - it can be run by importing the project file into Construct3 in a browser.

HubAndSpokes is a very rough Unreal Engine 5 game - it's included as more of an example in general of UE5 work that I've done than as a more polished game.
